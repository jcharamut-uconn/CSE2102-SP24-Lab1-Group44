Questions:

1. The meeting event code field is optional. How can you handle this field in TSL?
    I can have choices for whether the meeting event code is empty or not empty.

2. Notice that the some fields (e.g., “My dates are flexible” and “Include Nearby Airports”) are mutually exclusive. How can you use the [property] and [if] features of the TSL specification language to reflect this?
    I have "My dates are flexible" define a property that "Include Nearby Airports" checks for
    [property FlexibleDates] and [if !FlexibleDates]

3. When the Shop with Miles is selected, how does the form change? How may you reflect this in the TSL?
    When shop with miles is selected, the meeting code goes away and refundable fares is greyed out
    For Shop With Miles I define a property and have the meeting code check [if !ShopWithMiles], and the same for refundable fares
